# hello-world

This is just initial hello world file to create something to get an understanding of the mechanics of github & how to use it to create, store , edit , share & jointly work on projects . i'm sure that's not right jargon but I have to get used to working on coding for at least an hour a day & using github to create repositories & monitor & assess progress . Small steps but i already feel overwhelmed by social aspect of this coding adventure. Never fear they say..
